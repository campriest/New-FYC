# New-FYC
Objective: React and Socket.io Project--to create conversations around media.

Insipiration: Medium and dwell.


UI Stages:

1.
Notes: Create a three column structure to organize card content flow. Basic hamburg menu--it is not the main focus. So hiding the menu options will not confuse users. The main focus for menu is the header bar, which is displayed by text.

2.
Notes: Create card content structure. The cards will hold a visual element--photo or picture. A side menu bar has been added for the chat feature.

3.
Notes: Change the background to all white--less distraction and keeps design consistency. Adding a slim border radius creates separation and provides clean design elements to the card layout.
